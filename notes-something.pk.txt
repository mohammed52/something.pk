onUpdate is only called on client at redirection, it is not called when the page loads for the first time, it sets window.__INITIAL_STATE__ = null in the first time
--
each row should have its own component, for the actions methods to work simply

Ans: 
--
webpack also allows codesplitting, webpack is fairly advanced, need to learn

webpack.config file is “just JavaScript”
--
04 webpack.config files:
1. dev.config.js contains vendor
2. hot.reload.config.js no vendor
3. production.config.js vendor
4. server.ssr.config.js no vendor, 

each of the 04 versions is specified in package,json -> scripts , #2 is never used in package.json
--
nodemon - monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server
--
adding vendors in webpack.config.js, apparently no benefit, initial loading has gotton super slow
--
need to understand how weback.config->loaders are working
need to understand webpack.config settings for client server, dev prod
--
